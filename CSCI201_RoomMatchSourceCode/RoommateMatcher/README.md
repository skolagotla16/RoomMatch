# Welcome to RoomMatch!

# Our project will be a roommate matching service. People will be able to use it to find roommates in their area or where they choose to live, get in touch, and find recommended housing. The website will allow authenticated users to create profiles, choose housing locations, and match with other people. If someone chooses to not create an account and instead use the service as a guest, they will be able to see roommates, however, will be unable to match with them, as roommates will not be able to see them without the necessary information.


# Team Members: William Fu, Namiha Yasuda, Angie Jia, Senna Kolagotla, James Yim, Isabella Rocha
